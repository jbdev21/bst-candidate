# Ecom Volatile Pricing - Implementation Complete

A production-minded e-commerce checkout system for precious metals with volatile spot-indexed pricing, featuring quote-based pricing with expiration locks, idempotent checkout, and comprehensive test coverage.

**Stack**: Laravel 12, Vue 3 (Inertia), MySQL/SQLite (tests), TailwindCSS v4

## üöÄ Quick Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies and setup database
make setup

# Start development environment (server + queue + logs + vite)
composer run dev

# Or run individual services
php artisan serve    # Laravel server
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/demo` to see the interactive quote demo.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Core Domain Models
- **Products**: SKU-based precious metals with weight and premium pricing
- **SpotPrices**: Real-time market pricing with versioning for tolerance checks
- **PriceQuotes**: 5-minute locked quotes with basis tracking and tolerance thresholds
- **Orders/OrderLines**: Transactional order management with atomic checkout
- **IdempotencyKeys**: Ensures safe retry behavior for checkout operations

### Money Handling Strategy
- **Integer-only arithmetic**: All monetary values stored as integer cents
- **Custom Money class**: Provides safe multiplication/division with proper rounding
- **No floating-point operations**: Eliminates precision errors in financial calculations

### Concurrency & Idempotency
- **Database transactions**: All checkout operations wrapped in DB transactions for consistency
- **Idempotency keys**: Duplicate checkout requests with same key return identical results
- **Quote locking**: Prevents race conditions during the checkout process
- **Tolerance checking**: Protects against price movements during quote lifetime

## üîß API Endpoints

### Quote Generation
```bash
POST /api/quote
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "sku": "GOLD1OZ",
  "qty": 2
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "quote_id": 123,
  "unit_price_cents": 205000,
  "quote_expires_at": "2024-01-15T12:05:00.000000Z"
}
```

### Idempotent Checkout
```bash
POST /api/checkout
Content-Type: application/json
Idempotency-Key: {unique-uuid}
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "quote_id": 123
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order_id": 456,
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_abc123"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `409 {"error": "REQUOTE_REQUIRED"}` - Quote expired or price moved beyond tolerance
- `409 {"error": "OUT_OF_STOCK"}` - Insufficient inventory at fulfillment partner

### Payment Webhooks
```bash
POST /api/webhooks/payments
X-Signature: {hmac-sha256-signature}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_abc123",
  "event": "payment_authorized"
}
```

**Events:**
- `payment_authorized`: Transitions order from `pending` ‚Üí `authorized`
- `payment_captured`: Transitions order from `authorized` ‚Üí `captured`

### Mock Fulfillment API
```bash
# Check inventory
GET /api/mock-fulfillment/availability/GOLD1OZ
# Returns: {"available_qty": 10}

# Set inventory (for testing)
POST /api/mock-fulfillment/availability
{"sku": "GOLD1OZ", "available_qty": 50}
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage (100% of Requirements)
- **IntegerMoneyTest**: Verifies all pricing uses integer cents
- **QuoteExpiryTest**: Validates quote expiration handling with boundary conditions
- **ToleranceBreachTest**: Ensures spot price tolerance enforcement
- **IdempotencyTest**: Confirms duplicate requests return identical results
- **InventoryCheckTest**: Tests fulfillment partner integration
- **SignatureTest**: Validates webhook HMAC verification
- **InvalidSignatureTest**: Ensures invalid webhooks are rejected safely
- **TotalsIntegrityTest**: Verifies order math integrity (4 comprehensive test cases)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suites
php artisan test tests/Feature/Checkout
php artisan test tests/Feature/Pricing
php artisan test tests/Feature/Webhooks

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

## üé® User Interface Features

### Interactive Quote Demo (`/demo`)
- **Real-time countdown timer**: Shows `mm:ss` format, updates every second
- **Expiration handling**: Disables checkout at `00:00` with re-quote action
- **Friendly error messages**: Maps technical errors to user-friendly language
- **Loading states**: Proper disabled states during API requests
- **Accessibility**: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Error Mapping
- `REQUOTE_REQUIRED` ‚Üí "Prices moved while you were checking out. Get a fresh quote to continue."
- `OUT_OF_STOCK` ‚Üí "This item just sold out at our fulfillment partner. Try a smaller quantity or another product."
- `invalid_signature` ‚Üí "We couldn't confirm payment with the provider. Please retry."

## üîí Security & Validation

### Webhook Security
- **HMAC-SHA256 verification**: All webhook payloads verified against `PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- **Timing-safe comparison**: Uses `hash_equals()` to prevent timing attacks
- **State validation**: Only allows valid status transitions
- **Failure handling**: Invalid signatures return 400 with no state change

### Input Validation
- **Strict typing**: All controller methods use typed request classes
- **SQL injection protection**: All queries use Eloquent ORM or prepared statements
- **CSRF protection**: All form requests include CSRF tokens
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoints protected by Laravel's rate limiter

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Proper indexing**: Foreign keys and query-optimized indexes
- **Query efficiency**: Eager loading prevents N+1 query problems
- **Transaction isolation**: Minimal lock time during checkout operations

### Caching Strategy
- **Inventory caching**: Mock fulfillment responses cached for performance
- **Quote caching**: Spot prices cached at quote generation time
- **Session management**: Efficient session storage for UI state

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### Code Quality (CI Pipeline)
- **Laravel Pint**: Code formatting with Laravel preset
- **Larastan Level 6**: Static analysis with strict type checking
- **PHPUnit**: 100% test coverage of critical paths
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Frontend code quality

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Structured logging**: All webhook and fulfillment calls logged at INFO level
- **Error tracking**: Proper exception handling with context
- **Health checks**: Built-in Laravel health check endpoints

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variables
PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
PRICE_TOLERANCE_BPS=50  # Default 50 basis points (0.5%)
```

## üìà What I'd Do With More Time

### Enhanced Features
1. **Real-time price updates**: WebSocket integration for live spot price streaming
2. **Multi-currency support**: Support for different base currencies beyond USD


### Scalability Improvements
1. **Event sourcing**: Implement event-driven architecture for order management
2. **Message queues**: Async processing for webhook handling and notifications
3. **Database sharding**: Partition by user or geographic region
4. **CDN integration**: Asset delivery optimization

### Business Logic Extensions
1. **Dynamic tolerance**: Adjust tolerance based on market volatility
2. **Bulk ordering**: Support for large quantity purchases with volume discounts
3. **Audit logging**: Complete financial transaction audit trail

### Developer Experience
1. **OpenAPI documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation
2. **SDK generation**: Client libraries for multiple programming languages
3. **Integration testing**: End-to-end testing with external APIs
4. **Performance testing**: Load testing and benchmarking suite
